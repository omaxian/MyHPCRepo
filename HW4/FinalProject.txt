For my final project, I will work with Tristan and Anthony to develop a parallel IB method. To start, we can restrict to
Stokes flow so that the fluid solve can be done with parallel FFTs (we will call a library to handle this).
The IB method takes a structure with a set of points and forces, spreads the forces to the underlying fluid grid, 
solves the fluid equations on the grid, and then interpolates the result back to the structures. Interpolation
is embarassingly parallel. Spreading is more difficult, and will require some thought about how to do efficiently in
parallel.
